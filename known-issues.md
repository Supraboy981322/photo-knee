## These are the currently known issues in Photo-Knee.

Help needed: Things I do not know how and/or have the time to deal with

- PHP: I currently have yet to get the PHP files required for some of the functionality of PhotoPea
- There's an error thrown which I (oddly) can't seem to fix that haults the page from loading.
